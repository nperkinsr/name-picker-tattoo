# Name picker: Tattoo
**Name Picker: Tattoo** is a fun and interactive project designed to practice selecting random elements from an array. Users can input multiple names into the text field, then click the “Pick a Name” button to randomly select one of the names.

What makes this project special is the custom animation: once a name is selected, it appears as a tattoo being inked onto a tattooed guy illustration's chest. A creative way to visualise the chosen name!

This project helped me practice working with arrays, random selection, DOM manipulation, and adding animations to my web page.
